# can you change the values insude a list which is containd in set s?
#s = {8,9,12, "partha", [1,2]}

s = {8,9,12, "partha", [1,2]}

# no you cannot change the value inside list containd in a set in python ,
#you cannot even have a list as an element in a set becouse 
# sets in python requir all their element to be immutable and hashable 
#list are mutable and not hashable ,so they connot be added to set
